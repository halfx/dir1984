#
#
# This configuration file dictates the behaviour of dir1394.
# Each line must follow the structure:
# [directory] [user] [group] [access] [script(optional)]
# where
# [directory] is the directory to watch. To watch the subdirectories
# 		of this directory recursively, you have to preceed the 
# 		directory name by "-R". e.g.: "-R/home/user/watchme"
# [user] is the user you want to be owner of the file 
# 		if you want to keep the current owner just write "."
# [group] is the group you want to be owner of the file
#		if you want to keep the current owner just write "."
# [access] is the access permissions the file must have. 
#		The access parameter is splitted in 3 parts:
#		1) The access permission for the owner of the file
#		2) The access permission for the group owned of the file
#		3) The access permission for others
#		These 3 parts are separated by a ","
#		The possible permissions are:
#		0 --- no permission
#		1 --x execute 
#		2 -w- write 
#		3 -wx write and execute
#		4 r-- read
#		5 r-x read and execute
#		6 rw- read and write
#		7 rwx read, write and execute
#     		u current user access permissions
#		g current group access permissions
#		o current others access permissions
#
#		e.g.: u,u,0 will keep the current permission for the owner,
#		give the same permission as the owner to the users in the
#		owner group of the file and give no permission to other users
#		ugo will keep the current permissions.
#		Let's note that the permissions can also be written relatively
#		to u,g or o.
#		e.g: g+w,u-x,0 will set the permission of the user to the current
#		permission of the group owner plus the "write" permission,
#		the group owner permission will be set to the current permission
#		of the owner but without the "execute" permission and others will
#		have no permission at all.
#
#	[script|event1|event2...] is optional and represents the script which
#		will be executed when an event of type event1, event2, etc.
#     	occurs in [directory].	
#     	The following parameters will be given to the script:
#		[name] - the filename (absolute)
#		[event_type] - the type of event
#	
#
#		When present, the script will always be executed after the
#		instructions present in this configuration file are done
#		Please note that these scripts will be executed with root
#		privileges
#
#		Multiple scripts can be used for one directory with the same
#     		or different types of event support
